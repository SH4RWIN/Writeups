Flag Hunters

Description
Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default. Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.
The program's source code can be downloaded https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_verbal_sleep/9ae83ffa696e29c2b57d0373cb616bc097de3dda1e87e4780273e13de712abb6/lyric-reader.py

the program has a vulnerability in its logic of how it handles semicolumns. 
any statement written before a semicolumn and 'RETURN 0' will be executed.

payload: print(song_flag_hunters);RETURN 0
