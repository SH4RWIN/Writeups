# CTFs & Writeups Repository

> Welcome to my collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and writeups! This repository is a growing archive of CTF problems I have solved or am currently working on, along with writeups and solutions for each.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a different CTF challenge or event. Inside each folder, you'll typically find:

- `flag.txt` — The flag (if solved)
- `writeup.txt` — My writeup or solution for the challenge
- Challenge files (e.g., binaries, scripts, dumps, etc.)

### Example Layout
